# 🚀 LearnifAI
🧠A voice-first Chrome extension that helps developers instantly understand confusing code or complex docs using AI.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq

## 🎯 Objective
LearnifAI helps developers and learners overcome cognitive friction while reading technical content by turning voice commands into instant, spoken explanations of any selected text — all directly in the browser.  
Whether it’s a confusing code snippet or dense documentation, LearnifAI simplifies it with the power of Groq's LLM and reads it out loud in a voice you choose.
